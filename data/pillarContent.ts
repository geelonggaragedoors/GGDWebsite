At Geelong Garage Doors, we believe it should be as beautiful as it is functional. We offer a comprehensive range of residential doors tailored to the unique architectural styles of Geelong and the Surf Coast—from classic weatherboard homes in Newtown to modern coastal builds in Torquay.

        question: "What is the difference between a Roller Door and a Sectional Door?",
        answer: "A Roller Door consists of a continuous curtain of corrugated steel that rolls up into a drum above the opening. It's a classic, durable, and cost-effective choice, ideal for carports and sheds. A Sectional Door (or Panelift) is made of 4-5 rigid panels that slide up along the ceiling. Sectional doors offer a wider range of designs, profiles, and colours, including smooth finishes and windows, and generally provide better insulation and noise reduction."
      },
      {
        question: "How much does a new garage door cost in Geelong?",
        answer: "Pricing varies depending on size, style, and motor options. As a general guide for the Geelong market: Single Roller Doors start from approx. $1,200 installed. Single Sectional Doors start from approx. $2,200 installed. Custom Designer Doors can range from $4,000 to $10,000+. We provide free measure and quotes to give you an exact price."

        answer: "Yes! We service the entire Greater Geelong region, including Torquay, Jan Juc, Anglesea, Ocean Grove, Barwon Heads, Drysdale, and Portarlington. Our technicians are on the road daily in these areas."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I insulate my existing garage door?",
        answer: "Yes, we can retrofit insulation to most existing sectional garage doors using our Thermadoor or Cleverseal systems. This can reduce garage temperatures by up to 20°C in summer and keep it warmer in winter, while also significantly dampening street noise."

        question: "Do you offer 24/7 emergency repairs for commercial doors?",
        answer: "Yes, we have technicians on call 24/7 for commercial emergencies. We understand that a stuck door at a car park or warehouse is a critical security risk and operational hazard."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the difference between a roller shutter and a roller door?",
        answer: "A standard Commercial Roller Door is made from a continuous sheet of corrugated steel, similar to a residential door but stronger. A Roller Shutter consists of individual interlocking steel slats. Shutters are significantly stronger, easier to repair (as individual slats can be replaced), and can be made to much larger sizes."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you automate our manual chain-operated door?",
        answer: "In most cases, yes. We can retrofit heavy-duty industrial openers (like the Grifco eDrive) to existing manual doors, improving workplace safety and efficiency."

    ],
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "My opener is making a grinding noise, do I need a new one?",
        answer: "Not necessarily. A grinding noise often indicates worn gears or a lack of lubrication. If your opener is less than 10 years old, it might be repairable. If it's older, replacing it with a modern, safer unit is often more cost-effective."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if the power goes out?",
        answer: "All our openers have a manual release cord (usually red) that allows you to disengage the motor and operate the door by hand. For added peace of mind, we highly recommend choosing a model with Battery Backup, which keeps the door automatic during blackouts."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I open my garage door for a courier when I'm not home?",
        answer: "Yes! With the Merlin myQ app, you can receive an alert when the courier arrives, open the door from your phone to let them leave the package, and close it immediately after. You can even watch it happen if you have a myQ camera."

    faqs: [
      {
        question: "Why is my garage so dusty?",
        answer: "Standard garage doors, especially roller doors, have gaps at the sides and top. The slight vacuum created when you drive in pulls dust from outside. Installing our Cleverseal brush system seals these gaps effectively, reducing dust by up to 90%."

    faqs: [
      {
        question: "How do I know if my garage door spring is broken?",
        answer: "If your door is extremely heavy to lift manually, or if the opener is struggling/humming but not moving the door, you likely have a broken spring. You might also see a visible gap in the coil of the torsion spring above the door. DO NOT attempt to use the door or fix this yourself—springs are under extreme tension and are dangerous."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does my door reverse when it hits the floor?",
        answer: "This usually means the 'down limit' setting on your opener is set slightly too far, causing the door to think the floor is an obstruction. It can also be caused by debris in the tracks or safety beams being misaligned. A standard service call can fix this quickly."
